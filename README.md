# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

This project showcases an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The objective is to uncover patterns, visualize key relationships, and better understand the data structure before any modeling.

## 📁 Dataset

- `train.csv`: The dataset includes information about passengers on the Titanic, such as age, gender, ticket fare, and survival status.

> Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## 🔍 Objectives

- Understand the distribution of key variables (Age, Fare, Gender)
- Identify correlations and patterns
- Spot potential outliers and missing values
- Visualize relationships between features

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- ✅ Fare Boxplot
- ✅ Gender Distribution (Bar Chart)
- ✅ Age vs Fare (Scatterplot)
- ✅ Age by Gender (Boxplot)
- ✅ Correlation Heatmap
- ✅ Pairplot colored by Survival

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
